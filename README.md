## Description
This is a recreation of Fruit Ninja. The player receives an initial amount of money and uses the money to buy fruits (or other items) based on the prices given by the eBay API. Once an item is purchased, it is in the player's inventory, and he/she may continuously use it at no further cost. Before the game, the player is allowed to select from their "profile" 8 of items to use in the game. After each game, the player will earn money back as their “score.”

### Some Bugs :(

1. in profile.html, you might need to refresh a couple of times in order to see the proper icon (green/red) for every single item
2. in play.html, you might sometimes have to wait pretty long before items surface
3. as for equiping items, there is a bad request error when clicking the the buttons, \(you will have to scroll right in profile\), however this bad request error does not happen for some people
4. if you don't get the bad request error, there might be some display issues \(invisiable fruits\) in play
